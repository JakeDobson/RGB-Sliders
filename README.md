# RGB-Sliders
Simple app that changes the color of the box presented as the user slides one of three sliders at a time to orient the changing of color based on the RGB color system
You can push the view controller by tapping the "open" button, which will set the background color of that view to the square's color.

If you switch to the "Swift3" branch, the code has been converted to Swift 3 and refactored.
